# Bamzee-Requisition-Platform

This is a Requisition System for bamzee Engineering Company (www.bamzeeng.com), built with React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Next.js.

# How it Works
1. Employee from the company creates his/her account.
2. System Administrator approves the details of the employee.
3. The employee gains access to his/her account.
4. The employee can then request anything from the company like fuel, materials, facilitation, leave and many more.
5. After the employee requests, the request go to the first approver, the approver gets notified by email about the request.
6. when the approver approves it goes to approver 2 when he rejects, (he can reject with a comment) and it goes back to the employee who requested.
7. when the approver 2 approves, it goes to the finance and the employee gets handled.
8.
