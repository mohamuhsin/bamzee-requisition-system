# Bamzee-Requisition-Platform

This is a Requisition System for bamzee Engineering Company (www.bamzeeng.com), built with React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Next.js.

# How it Works
1. Employee from the company creates his/her account.
2. System Administrator approves the details of the employee.
3. The employee gains access to his/her account.
4. The employee can then request anything from the company like fuel, materials, facilitation, leave and many more.
5. After the employee requests, the request go to the first approver, the approver gets notified by email about the request.
6. when the approver approves it goes to approver 2.
7. When he rejects, (he can reject with a comment) and it goes back to the employee who requested.
8. when the approver 2 approves, it goes to the finance and the employee gets handled.
9. After the employee gets the funds, he will be able to upload the receipts back to the system for accountability.
10. The System will have a dashboard for a project manager, who creates projects and employees can make requests.

# The problems the system will be solving
1. It will eradicate the use of paper for requisitions.
2. it will help in proper accountability at the end of the year.
3. It will help project managers track how much funds used in their projects.
